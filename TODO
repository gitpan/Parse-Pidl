- true multiple dimension array / strings in arrays support

- compatibility mode for generating MIDL-readable data:
 - strip out pidl-specific properties

- don't be so strict on array boundaries.. arrays can and will be empty when 
  a (regular) remote error occurs
 
- support nested elements
 - generate names for anonymous tagged types

- auto-alloc [ref] pointers for Samba4 during pull if they were NULL
 
- replace subcontext() with represent_as()

- --explain-ndr option that dumps out parse tree ?
